        // You could be puzzled by the following lines
        //
        // The reason why these lines are necessary is the fact that Java is ambiguous. There are cases where the
        // sequence of characters ">>>" and ">>" should be recognized as the single tokens ">>>" and ">>". In other
        // cases however we want to split those characters in single GT tokens (">").
        //
        // For example, in expressions ">>" and ">>>" are valid, while when defining types we could have this:
        //
        //   List<List<Set<String>>>>
        //
        // You can see that the sequence ">>>>" should be interpreted as four consecutive ">" tokens closing a type
        // parameter list.
        //
        // The JavaCC handle this case by first recognizing always the longest token, and then depending on the context
        // putting back the unused chars in the stream. However in those cases the token provided is invalid: it has an
        // image corresponding to the text originally recognized, without considering that after some characters could
        // have been put back into the stream.
        //
        // So in the case of:
        //
        //   List<List<Set<String>>>>
        //                       ___   -> recognized as ">>>", then ">>" put back in the stream but
        //                                Token(type=GT, image=">>>") passed to this class
        //                        ___  -> recognized as ">>>", then ">>" put back in the stream but
        //                                Token(type=GT, image=">>>") passed to this class
        //                         __  -> recognized as ">>", then ">" put back in the stream but
        //                                Token(type=GT, image=">>") passed to this class
        //                          _  -> Token(type=GT, image=">") good!
        //
        // So given the image could be wrong but the type is correct, we look at the type of the token and we fix
        // the image. Everybody is happy and we can keep this horrible thing as our little secret.
